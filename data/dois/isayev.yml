description: 
  The dataset files contain low-energy conformers and tautomers of 6,433 FDA approved & investigational drugs. 
  A collection consists of 32,036 tautomeric structures and ~3M conformers. After extensive sampling, for every 
  tautomer we found low laying conformers within approx. 6 kcal/mol window using ANI-2x neural-network molecular 
  potential. The ANI-2x potential is approaching the accuracy of high-level QM calculations (wB97x-D).
  For each conformer we list total energy, relative energy, and dipole-consistent partial atomic charges.
