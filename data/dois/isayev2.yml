description: 
  The dataset files contain low-energy conformers and tautomers for 20,306 from the CAS Antiviral database. 
  Original ~50K molecules were filtered for duplicates and drug-likeness. A collection consists of 67,167 
  tautomeric structures and ~6.6M conformers. After extensive sampling, for every tautomer we found low 
  laying conformers within approx. 6 kcal/mol window using ANI-2x neural-network molecular potential. 
  The ANI-2x potential is approaching the accuracy of high-level QM calculations (wB97x-D). For each conformer 
  we list total energy, relative energy, and dipole-consistent partial atomic charges.
