name: "SARS-CoV-2 PLpro: ISOLDE refined model"
pdbids:
  - 6w9c
proteins:
  - PLpro
organism:
  - SARS-CoV-2
description: >
  Refinement of 6w9c (a 2.7A X-ray structure) of papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 that contains three copies of the same chain in the asymmetric unit.
  Corrects several issues:
  * Corrects zinc site in chain A misidentified as a disulfide, and incompletely modeled site in chain B; the same zinc site is correctly modeled in chain C.
  * Cleans up lots of issues due to missing data (overall completeness 57.1%)
  See [a complete description](https://twitter.com/CrollTristan/status/1245322667093352448) of the issues remedied by this model.
