name: "SARS-CoV-2 RdRP (NSP12) in complex with NSP7 and two copies of NSP8: ISOLDE refined model"
pdbids:
  - 6m71
proteins:
  - RdRP
  - NSP7
  - NSP8
organism:
  - SARS-CoV-2
description: >
  Refinement of 6m71 that fixes multiple issues:
  * Corrects incorrect modeling of both zinc binding sites (originally modeled as disulfides)
  * Corrects 1-2 dozen rotamer adjustments and peptide flips
  * Models C-terminal domain of chain D (one of the NSP8s) using well-resolved chain B
  See [a complete description](https://twitter.com/CrollTristan/status/1245281058347761665) of the issues remedied by this model.
