name: "SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound with S309: ISOLDE refined model with N343 glycan and P337L mutation"
pdbids:
  - 7jx3
proteins:
  - spike
  - RBD
organism:
  - SARS-CoV-2
description: >
  Refinement of 7JX3 that fixes multiple issues:
  * Adjusts a few rotamers and peptide bonds
  * Merges in missing loop in antibody constant domain from 4jhw
  * Builds in N343 glycan
  Mutates RBD's P337 to LEU using PyMOL.
