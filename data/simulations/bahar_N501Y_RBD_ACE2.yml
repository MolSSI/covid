title: 3 x 100 ns MD of N501Y SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex (Alpha variant)
description: >
  This trajectory is from three 100 ns atomic MD simulation of the Alpha variant SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex. 
  The protein was solvated in a box of water and 0.15 M NaCl extending 10 A from protein edges. 
  The simulation was performed with NAMD 2.13 on the department cluster using the CHARMM36m force field. 
  The interval between frames is 10 ns. The simulation was conducted in the NPT ensemble (1 bar and 310 K).
