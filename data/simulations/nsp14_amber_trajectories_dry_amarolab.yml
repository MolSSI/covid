title: NAMD Trajectories of full-length NSP14 protein.
description: All-atom MD simulations of full-length NSP14 protein, protein only (aligned) after water molecules and ions are stripped. This is a concatanated trajectory of three independent copies (2x1µs + 1x0.6µs). PSF and DCDs files are provided.
