title: Folding@home simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD bound to monoclonal antibody S2H97
description: >
  All-atom MD simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) bound to
  monoclonal antibody S2H97, simulated using
  [Folding@Home](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.175430).
  Complete details of this simulation are available [here](https://github.com/choderalab/rbd-ab-contact-analysis/).
  Brief details appear below.

  **System preparation:**
  The RBD:S2H97 complex was constructed from PDB ID 7M7W (Chains S, C, and D). 
  7M7W was first refined using ISOLDE to better fit the experimental electron density using detailed manual inspection. 
  Refinement included building in a missing four-residue-long loop. 
  ISOLDE was used to construct a complex glycan at N343. 
  The full glycosylation pattern was determined from Shajahan et al. and Watanabe et al.
  The glycan structure used for N343 (FA2G2) corresponds to the most stable conformer obtained from multi microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of cumulative sampling.
  The equilibrated structure was then used to initiate parallel distributed MD simulations on Folding@home ([Shirts and Pande, 2000](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/290/5498/1903.full), [Zimmerman et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.175430)).
  Simulations were run with OpenMM 7.4.2 (Folding@home core22 0.0.13).
  Production simulations used the same Langevin integrator as the NpT equilibration described above.
  In total, 4985 independent MD simulations were generated on Folding@home.
  Conformational snapshots (frames) were stored at an interval of 1 ns/frame for subsequent analysis.
  The resulting final dataset contained 4985 trajectories, 623.7 us of aggregate simulation time.
  **Solute-only trajectories:**
  The solute-only trajectories (with counterions) are available as [MDTraj HDF5 files](https://mdtraj.org/1.9.4/hdf5_format.html) that contain both topology and trajectory information.
  A single trajectory (RUN0 CLONE0) (~29 MB) can be downloaded using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request cp s3://fah-public-data-covid19-antibodies.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/vir-collaboration/SARS-CoV-2-RBD-antibody/munged/solute/17347/run0-clone0.h5 .
   ```
  All HDF5 trajectories can be retrieved with
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://https://fah-public-data-covid19-antibodies.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/vir-collaboration/SARS-CoV-2-RBD-antibody/munged/solute/17347.
   ```
  **Entire dataset:**
  The raw Folding@home dataset is made available through the [AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/foldingathome-covid19/) and can be retrieved through the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
  The dataset consists of a single project (`PROJ17347`) and has a `RUN*/CLONE*/result*` directory structure.
  `RUNs` denote different equilibrated starting structures.
  `CLONE`s denote different independent replica trajectories.
  To retrieve raw trajectory files in [gromacs XTC format](http://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.4/online/xtc.html)
  for the whole dataset, you can use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-antibodies.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/vir-collaboration/SARS-CoV-2-RBD-antibody/raw-data/PROJ17347 .
   ```
  **Folding@home initial files:** System setup and input files can be downloaded using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-antibodies.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/vir-collaboration/SARS-CoV-2-RBD-antibody/setup-files/17347 .
