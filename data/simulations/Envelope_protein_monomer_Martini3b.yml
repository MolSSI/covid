title: Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein E in the monomeric form
description: > 
    1. The trajectories of coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 
       unmodified, palmitoylated, glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 E protein in the monomeric form in a POPC bilayer. 
    2. The trajectories of CG MD of systems containing 2 proteins in the curved membranes.
