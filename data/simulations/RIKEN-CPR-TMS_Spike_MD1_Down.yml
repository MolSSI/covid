title: Riken CPR TMS, MD1_Down trajectory
description: >
    The data set includes a trajectory file from Molecular Dynamics (MD) of a fully glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in solution. Water molecules and counter ions were excluded. 
    The starting structure is an inactive Down taken from CHARMM-GUI COVID-19 Archive (http://www.charmm-gui.org/docs/archive/covid19). We replaced counter ions K+ in the original model with Na+. The simulation used CHARMM36m force field for protein, and TIP3P water model.  The simulation was performed using GENESIS.
    The coordinates were saved every 1 nanoseconds and aligned to S2 domain (Calpha atoms of residues 689-727, 854-1147).
