title: NAMD Trajectories of NSP14-NSP10-RNA complex.
description: All-atom MD simulations of NSP14-NSP10-RNA complex, protein and RNA only (aligned) after water molecules and ions are stripped. This is a concatanated trajectory of three independent copies (2x1µs + 1x0.6µs). PSF and DCDs files are provided.
