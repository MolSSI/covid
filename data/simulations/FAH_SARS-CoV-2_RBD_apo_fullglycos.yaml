title: Folding@home simulations of the apo SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (with glycosylation)
description: >
  All-atom MD simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) (with glycosylation), simulated using
  [Folding@Home](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.175430).
  Complete details of this simulation are available [here](https://github.com/choderalab/rbd-ace2-contact-analysis/tree/main/additional_data/6m0j_RBD_fullglycos).
  Brief details appear below.

  **System preparation:**
  The RBD complex was constructed from PDB ID 6M0J (Chain B). 
  6M0J was refined using ISOLDE to better fit the experimental electron density using detailed manual inspection. ACE2 (+ associated glycans) were then deleted.
  The equilibrated structure was then used to initiate parallel distributed MD simulations on Folding@home ([Shirts and Pande, 2000](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/290/5498/1903.full), [Zimmerman et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.175430)).
  Simulations were run with OpenMM 7.4.2 (Folding@home core22 0.0.13).
  Production simulations used the same Langevin integrator as the NPT equilibration described above.
  In total, 2995 independent MD simulations were generated on Folding@home.
  Conformational snapshots (frames) were stored at an interval of 1 ns/frame for subsequent analysis.
  The resulting final dataset contained 2995 trajectories, 1.8 ms of aggregate simulation time.
  **Solute-only trajectories:**
  The solute-only trajectories (with counterions) are available as [MDTraj HDF5 files](https://mdtraj.org/1.9.4/hdf5_format.html) that contain both topology and trajectory information.
  A single trajectory (RUN0 CLONE0) can be downloaded using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request cp s3://fah-public-data-covid19-antibodies/vir-collaboration/SARS-CoV-2-RBD-apo/munged/solute/17314/run0-clone0.h5 .
   ```
  All HDF5 trajectories can be retrieved with
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-antibodies/vir-collaboration/SARS-CoV-2-RBD-apo/munged/solute/17314 .
   ```
  **Entire dataset:**
  The raw Folding@home dataset is made available through the [AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/foldingathome-covid19/) and can be retrieved through the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
  The dataset consists of a single project (`PROJ17314`) and has a `RUN*/CLONE*/result*` directory structure.
  `RUNs` denote different equilibrated starting structures.
  `CLONE`s denote different independent replica trajectories.
  To retrieve raw trajectory files in [gromacs XTC format](http://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.4/online/xtc.html)
  for the whole dataset, you can use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-antibodies/vir-collaboration/SARS-CoV-2-RBD-apo/raw/PROJ17314 .
   ```
  **Folding@home initial files:** System setup and input files can be downloaded using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-antibodies/vir-collaboration/SARS-CoV-2-RBD-apo/setup-files/17314 .
