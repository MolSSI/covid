title: MMGB/SA Consensus Estimate of the Binding Free Energy Between the Novel Coronavirus Spike Protein to the Human ACE2 Receptor
description:
	50 ns simulation trajectory of a truncated SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain the human ACE2 receptor.
	The simulations used the Amber ff14SB force field and the OPC water model.
	The initial structure (PDB ID:6m0j) was truncated in order to obtain a smaller complex feasible with the computational framework.
	A molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MMGB/SA) approach was employed to estimate absolute binding free energy of the truncated complex.
	The system was neutralized and salted with NaCl, with a final concentration of 0.15 M.The simulations were conducted at 300 K in the NPT ensemble.
