title: DESRES-ANTON-10906555 2 µs simulations of 50 FDA approved or investigational drug molecules binding to a construct of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein, no water or ions
description: >
  50 2 µs trajectories of FDA approved or investigational drug molecules that in simulation remained bound to a construct of the SARS-CoV-2
  trimeric spike protein at positions that might conceivably allosterically disrupt the interaction between these proteins. The small
  molecule drugs and their initial binding poses were chosen from a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and
  docking performed using an FDA-investigational drug library. The 50 putative spike protein binding small molecules located at three regions
  on the spike trimer, a pocket in the RBD whose formation may possibly enhance RBD-RBD interactions in the closed conformation (8 molecules),
  a pocket between the two RBDs in the closed conformation (29 molecules), and a pocket that involves three RBDs in the closed conformation (13 molecules).
  The simulations used the Amber ff99SB-ILDN force field for proteins, the CHARMM TIP3P model for water, and the generalized Amber force field
  for small molecules. The C- and N-peptide termini were capped with amide and acetyl groups respectively. The spike trimer construct was modeled 
  from PDB entries 6VXX and 6VW1, only retaining the RBD and a short region from S1 fusion protein as a minimal system for maintaining a trimer assembly. 
  The system was neutralized and salted with NaCl, with a final concentration of 0.15 M. The interval between frames is 1.2 ns. The simulations were 
  conducted at 310 K in the NPT ensemble.
