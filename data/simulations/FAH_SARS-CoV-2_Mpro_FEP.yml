title: Folding@home expanded ensemble absolute free energy calculations of potential small molecule inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease from the COVID Moonshot
description: >
  This dataset contains all-atom expanded ensemble absolute free calculations for
  potential small molecule inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main viral protease (Mpro, 3CLpro)
  from the [COVID Moonshot](https://postera.ai/covid) simulated on Folding@home with [gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org/).

  Molecules from datasets prefixed with "MS" were crowdsourced small molecule designs
  submitted to the [COVID Moonshot](http://postera.ai/covid).

  Each small molecule was run alone in solution and docked to Mpro to compute absolute free energies of binding.
  Simulations were run using GROMACS-5.0.4 or GROMACS-2020 and are stored as compressed binary XTC files.
  Absolute free energies were computed using an expanded ensemble scheme, using 40 lambdas to decouple the ligand interactions.
  Free energy data for each alchemical lambda is stored in the `md.log` file, and found more concisely in pre-scraped pickle (`.pkl`) dataframes.
  The dataset comprises several projects, each having a `RUN*/CLONE*/result*` directory structure:
  * each `PROJ` represents a different dataset of small molecules
  * each `RUN` represents a different small molecule
  * each `CLONE` is a unique MD simulation differing in initial atomic velocities
  * each `result*` is a fragment of the contiguous simulation

  For the case of ligand-only "L" simulations, each XTC represents 10ns of sampling,
  while each complex "RL" xtc trajectory is only 1 ns.
  More information about the simulation set-up can be found [here](https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/covid-moonshot/blob/master/folding-at-home_submissions/COVID%20Moonshot%20051220%20Release%20Announcement.pdf).
  In order to find particular `PROJ`/`RUN `of interest, see the `results` and `organization` dataframes.

  **Organization dataframe:** In order to determine systems of interest, you can parse [this dataframe](https://fah-public-data-covid19-absolute-free-energy/free_energy_data/organization.pkl) which contains information on which ligands are present in each project/run. Half of the projects contain trajectories for ligands alone in solution, while the other half contain trajectories for ligands docked to the main protease. More data is being added to this repository every day, so if a project/run is not available in the AWS bucket, check back later or contact [Matt Hurley](mailto:tug27224@temple.edu).

  **Topology files:** Structure and topology files corresponding to each run can
  be found in the build directories. All-atom files that include solvent and
  ions are named `npt.gro`, while files containing only protein and ligand information are named `xtc.gro`.
  Other files of interest include the force-field parameters, stored in `topol.top`, and `prod.mdp`,
  which holds the MD parameters for running expanded ensemble simulations.
  The dataset is available through the [AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/foldingathome-covid19/) and can be retrieved through the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

  For example, to retrieve the whole project 14721:
    ```bash
    aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-absolute-free-energy/build/p14721 .
    ```
  To retrieve a a specific RUN (`RUN0`):
    ```bash
    aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-absolute-free-energy/build/p14722/RUN0 .
    ```
  To retrieve a specific pair of `.gro` files from specific RUNs:
    ```bash
    aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-absolute-free-energy/build/p14725/RUN10/npt.gro .
    aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-asbolute-free-energy/build/p14727/RUN20/xtc.gro .
    ```
  **Raw datasets:** To get the raw trajectory files [gromacs XTC format](http://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.4/online/xtc.html)
  for the whole dataset (~10+ TB/`PROJ`ect), you can use the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/):
   ```bash
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-absolute-free-energy/SVR51748107/PROJ14721 .
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-absolute-free-energy/SVR51748107/PROJ14722/RUN2 .
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-absolute-free-energy/SVR51748107/PROJ14725/RUN2/CLONE1 .
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-absolute-free-energy/SVR51748107/PROJ14727/RUN2/CLONE1/results0 .
   aws s3 --no-sign-request sync s3://fah-public-data-covid19-absolute-free-energy/SVR51748107/PROJ14728/RUN2/CLONE1/results0/traj_comp.xtc .

  **Results dataframes:** Compiled free energy results, extracted from each work
  unit's log file can be found in the `free-energy-data` path.
  These dataframes are organized by dataset and contain the corresponding project
  number for accessing the raw data. A dataframe containing the most recently computed
  free energies of binding can be found [here](https://fah-public-data-covid19-absolute-free-energy/free_energy_data/results.pkl).
  All other dataframes can be downloaded using [AWS CLI[(https://aws.amazon.com/cli):
